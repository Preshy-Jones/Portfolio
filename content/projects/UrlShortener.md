A mini full stack app powered by a nodejs api and a react frontend. I developed an
endpoint to take in and validate an input url and generate a unique short code. When
the short code is then accessed as a route in the base of my deployed base url, it
redirects to the input url of the user. If the base url name was short such as bit in bit.ly, it
works as a url shortener. I used a basic vite react app to consume the api and chakra
ui for styling.
