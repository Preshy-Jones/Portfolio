A fully functional full stack application website built with Laravel, Mysql and redis on the backend and Livewire,tailwind and jquery on the frontend. I built a functional user dashboard for customers to track their bookings, a dashboard for the cleaners to track their customers bookings, and an admin dashboard for the client to manage all the data including all bookings. I also integrated a payment system using Paystack to process the payments for all bookings made and employed the use of redis to manage session data.
