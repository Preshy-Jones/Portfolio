A web3 dapp that enables users to send ethereum from one wallet to another. Users after connecting their wallet can input the recipient address, amount, a message and a Keyword. The keyword is used to query a giphy api to return a gif image matching the keyword. The user can then send the transaction to the recipient address. The recipient can then view the message and gif image sent to them.
